## Usage

1. **Start the Service**  
   Use the Services app (`services.msc`) or run:
   ```powershell
   & 'C:\Windows\System32\sc.exe' start AndroidDataProcessorService
   ```

2. **Send Data**  
   - Send HTTP POST requests to the configured port (default: 8080).
   - Ensure your requests include the required headers and payload structure as specified in your API documentation.

3. **Monitor Logs**  
   - Log files are created in the specified directory (see `appsettings.json`).
   - Review logs for incoming requests, errors, and service activity.

## Configuration

- Edit `appsettings.json` (located alongside the executable) to set:
  - SQL Server connection string
  - Listening port
  - Log file location and log level

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Service wonâ€™t start:**  
  - Check Windows Event Viewer (`eventvwr.msc`) and log files for errors.
  - Ensure correct permissions and valid configuration.

- **Port conflicts:**  
  - Change the listening port in `appsettings.json` if 8080 is already in use.

- **Database issues:**  
  - Confirm SQL Server is running and accessible.
  - Verify your connection string and credentials.
